Storing Password :-
                  We never store the passwords as it is, We store their
                  hashed form.
                  --------------------------------------------------------
                  Password      usingFunction       Now it is stored
                  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  "hello" ---> Hashing Function ---> "935a185caaa266bb9cbe98l588eb744tta288l199dbb56b933k457ae8bo0"

Hashing :-
          For every input, there is a fixed output.
          They are one-way functions, we can't get input from output.
          For different input, there is a different output but of same langth
          Small changes in input should bring large changes in output.

Salting :-
         Password salting is a technique to protect passwords stored in databases
         by adding a string of 32 or more characters and then hashing them.

Passport :-
           Passport is a library that helps us to handle user authentication.
           Passport is Express-compatible authentication middleware for Node.js.
           --------------------------------------------------------------------
Passport-Local :-
                Passport-Local is a strategy for authenticating with a username
                and password.
                ----------------------------------------------------------------
Passport-Local-Mongoose :-
                        Passport-Local Mongoose is a Mongoose plugin that simplifies
                        building username and password login with Passport.
                        -------------------------------------------------------------
                        You're free to define your userSchema how you like.
                        Passport-Local Mongoose will add a username, hash and salt field
                        to store the username, the hashed password and the salt value.
                        Additionally, Passport-Local Mongoose adds some methods to your
                        Schema. See the API Documentation for more details.
                        -----------------------------------------------------------------
passport.initialize() :- A middleware that initializes passport.
passport.session() :- A web application needs the ability to identify users as they
                      browse from page to page. This series of requests and responses,
                      each associated with the same user, is known as a session.
passport.use(new LocalStrategy( User.authenticate() ))
passport.serializeUser( User.serializeUser() )
passport.deserializeUser( User.deserializeUser() )
